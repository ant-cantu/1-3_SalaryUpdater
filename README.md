# Price Mark Up

## About Price Mark Up

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created within the first few weeks of my class and
is very simple and follows exactly what my professor wanted. 
The application reads a file, manipulates the data,
and outputs the data to another file.

## Built With

## Source Code:
> [Source Code](https://github.com/ant-cantu/SalaryUpdater/blob/main/SalaryUpdater.cpp)

## Getting Started

This is a standalone application, no installation is required.

1. Download the file
> [Click to Download](https://github.com/ant-cantu/PriceMarkUp/blob/main/L1-2.exe)

2. Run the application.
3. Make sure the L1-3DATA.txt file is in the same location as the executable.
5. Review the output in the console.
6. Review the output in the newly created file: L1-3DATA.dat

## Usage

The program is made using C++, the program will read data from the file named
L1-3DATA.txt. The program takes this information and maniuplates the data using
math to find the total of the current salaries stored within the file and then
outputs the total of the updated salary along with their first name and last name
to the new file named L1-3DATA.dat. It will display the current salaries and the
updated salaries in the console as well.

It is assumed the user will have the L1-3DATA.txt file as there are no error
checks within this code.
